# Regression Types

--simple linear regression 

predicts variable y(dependent variable) based on another variable x(dependent variable)

it is  simple because it examines  btn two variables only. It is linear because the variable increases or decreases in a linear fashion.

i.e salary employee  based on  years of experience. The salary goes up as years of experience increases 
  y= mx+b        m: slope of the line , b is y-intercept
  
  --multiple linear regression 
  
  examines the relationship btn more than 2 variables ie=  bo+ m1x1+ m2x2+ ----
  
  ie. take the salary example above and years of education to determine the employee's salary based on years of experience and years of education
  
  --Polynomial regression
