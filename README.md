# Machine Learning 

- The puprose of ML is to make machines more self-sufficient so that they are able to analyze data , recognize pattern, automate processes and make them more efficient 
- Statistical Modelling is a subfield of math that deals with finding relationships between
variables to predict outcomes.

# Supervised learning

Teach the model with labeled dataset, then with that knowledge have it predict future instances

#  types of SL

- Classification : organizing/classify labeled data
- Regression : predict trends using labeled data to determine future outcomes
#   K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)
The K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm (K-NN or KNN) is a supervised learning method used for classification and regression.
  
# Unsupervised learning

We do not supervise the model, but we let the model work on its own to discover information that may not be visible to the human eye. 
- Uses UNLABELED data.
- Unsupervised Learning usually deals with algorithms that utilize centroids.


Some of these algorithms include:
-  K-means clustering,
-  Hierarchical clustering
- Density-based clustering

Clustering( unspervised learning type) is the analysis of patterns and groupings of unlabeled data.

Out-of-sample data means data that is outside of the dataset used to train the model.


# Regression Types

- Simple linear regression 

predicts variable y(dependent variable) based on another variable x(independent variable)

it is  simple because it examines  btn two variables only. It is linear because the variable increases or decreases in a linear fashion.

i.e salary employee  based on  years of experience. The salary goes up as years of experience increases 
  y= mx+b        m: slope of the line , b is y-intercept
  
  - Multiple linear regression 
  
  examines the relationship btn more than 2 variables ie=  bo+ m1x1+ m2x2+ ----
  
  ie. take the salary example above and years of education to determine the employee's salary based on years of experience and years of education
  
  - Polynomial regression
